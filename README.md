This is a game based project which uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for development. This game is a simple snake game which is fun to play and it also recrods your high score on your local storage so that you can comeback and compepte again. 
The keys used to play this game are UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT for and the game ends if you end up biting yourself or hit the wall.
On development based level this game is developed by using math based geometry and different functions which compile to produce the required result.
The display is a grid based so that user the position of the food and the snake could be marked for the start of the game and also there are different sound based on what really is the scenario inside the game.
The food function used coordinate as well as the random function to generate food at random locations but only inside the grid where it is not overlapping with the body the snake itself.
To make the game a bit easy to be played user the generation of food inside the coordinates for the food function would be a bit less than the walls of the game so that the user does not end up losing whenever the food generates near the wall.
